## üé≤ Version support

| Minecraft version | Latest mod version | Support status            |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1.20.2            | `3.0`              | :heavy_check_mark: Active |
| 1.14.0 - 1.20.1   | `2.4`              | :warning: Bug fixes only  |
| 1.12.2, 1.13.2    | `2.4`              | :warning: Bug fixes only  |

Starting with v3.0 this mod will only be developed for the latest Minecraft version available.
It's a lot of work to develop, test, release a mod for 26+ different versions of Minecraft and I don't have the time for that anymore.
Versions 2.x of the mod will still receive bug fixes, for the time being.
